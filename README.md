Interpretable AI in Portfolio Management:
Ensemble Rule Models and Causal Pruning via Large Language Models

By Jordon Birks

This is the python code for my MSc dissertation, which applies an interpretable machine learning stock selection system to emerging markets portfolio management. This is done by using an association rule mining method, which mines rules for the equities data that imply 80th percentile returns. This is then extended into causal rule mining and making ensemble models out of the causal rulesets. Monte-Carlo experiments were also used to assess the ability of these models to mine causal rules. The notebooks are to be run in the order that they are numbered. Note that you will need an Open AI API key to run notebooks 3 and 6.
